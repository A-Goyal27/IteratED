Question: [question]  
Answer: [answer]  
Chat log: [chat log]  
Synopsis: [prior synopsis]  

Summarize student progress:
– What parts have they correctly answered (based on the final answer)?  
– What parts are they still struggling with or have not yet answered?  
– Count an answer as correct if it’s valid and complete, even if phrased differently.  
– Avoid fluff.

If both the previous synopsis AND the last 2–3 chats show repeated struggle with the same step, add:  
→ STEP ANSWER OK: [brief step description]

Don’t repeat the STEP ANSWER OK flag if already used in the last summary.

End with either:  
– STATUS: COMPLETE  
– STATUS: INCOMPLETE

Mark STATUS: COMPLETE *only if*:  
→ The student must have answered all parts of the question (including units, if needed) in their latest response.
